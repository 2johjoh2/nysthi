v0.4.0D 2017-10-24

- some little restyling (all the outputs are black)

- NYSTEREOPHASER 
	added full stereo input

- SURVEILLANCE
	added switch to have 2 ranges 
		A) from -5v to +5v
		B) from 0v to +10v

- NYSTEREOCHORUS
	new module,a stereo chorus with some nice new params

- DUALSIGNALDELAYER (aks 2D)
	dual delay from 0 to 2000 msecs
	both delays are CV controllable

- NYENVFOLLOWER
	a classic Envelope Follower with :
	
		A) GAIN IN (multiply the incoming signal form 1 to 10)
		B) ATTACK time (from 0.5 to 250 msecs)
		C) RELEASE time (from 0.5 to 250 msecs)
		D) SCALE multiply the signal for -20v to 20v
		E) OFFSET add to the signal from (-20v to 20v)
		F) DELAY ENV delays the generated signal from 0 to 200msecs
		G) ENVELOPE OUT the generated signal
		H) DELAY SIGNAL delays the original signal from 0 to 200 msecs
		I) SIGNAL OUT the original signal in, shifted by DELAY SIGNAL
		K) OSZI (oscilloskope) ON/OFF button (to spare cpu time!)
		L) SCALE gain of the signal and time
		

v0.4.0C 2017-10-24

- NYSTEREOPHASER
	debuggin nasty nysthi noise (thanks Ivan!)
	added 4 different algorithms
	debbugged light show
	added 4 waveshapes for inner vco

- SURVEILLANCE
	new module: one control to send 10 different voltages
	the main pot goes from -5 to +5
	all the outs are controlled by attuenverters


v0.4.0B 2017-10-22

- LOGIC 
	removed module (obsolete)

- MVERB 
	now is 1 to 1 equivalent to the mVerb

- HI-VERB
	removed clear during room resize

- TWISTEDMVERB
	removed clear during room resize

- MODEL277
	removed filters from feedback paths
	removed smoothers on parameters changes
	timing is now the same as the Buchal 277 from 5 to 200 msecs
	added 10x time multiplier, bringing the time from 50 to 2000 msecs
	solved a bug on feeback paths 3 and 4

- NYSTEREOPHASER
	added new stero phaser, original design, based on 4th orders Allpasses (WOW :D)
	

v0.4.0 2017-10-15 FIRST RELEASE

- MVERB
	a VCV RACK port of the mverb
	https://github.com/martineastwood/mverb

- HI-VERB
	a mutation of the MVERB using HIPASS filtering

- TWISTEDMVERB
	another mutation, of the MVERB with 8 delay lines and 4 allpass added 
	+ some parameter tweaking

- MODEL277
	a feedback delay tool, freely inspired from Buchla 277

- LOGIC
	a simple module for boolean logic, Was my gym to learn VCV modules
