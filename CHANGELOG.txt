v0.5.4.1  2017-12-05
-- SOYMODELSOU
ADD: new extra selection for QRV, if DATA SET REPEATABLE is OFF, is guaranteed that all data selected will
be all different (no repeated quantized steps)
BUG: the SOU was not starting if his buddy "HOTTUNA" was not present... ;) Now, is starting alone
BUG: the QRV section had a WRONG count on N+1 when POT was on 1 (you didn't notice... but I'm picky)
BUG: the SRV SKEW function was overflowing if modulated

v0.5.4  2017-12-03
-- THE SQUONK
it's a PROGRAMMER, STAGE sequencer, Sampler TRIGGER, freely inspired to Serge TKB
is 12 steps with 11 lines of programming

line 1: TRIG IN: will select the stage triggered
line 2: STAGE: is the stage selector by button. when in sequencer mode the current step will light up
line 3: 5X: voltage multiplier for A B C D E channels
line 4: A: CV channel from 0 to 2 volts
line 5: B: CV channel from 0 to 2 volts
line 6: C: CV channel from 0 to 2 volts
line 7: D: CV channel from -1 to 1 volts
line 8: E: CV channel from -1 to 1 volts
line 9: MODE: TRIG mode; if bright yellow, CV and TRIG out, if dark yellow, only CV out, if black step is jumped
line 10: REP: if the sequencer is clocked will retrig the step from 1 to 8 times (subdivisions) (ratcheting)
line 11: TRIG OUT: single PULSE out when the stage is selected

SEL knob: will select the current stage
SEL CV input: selection of stage using CV (0 -> 10v)
CLK IN CLK OUT: to clock the sequencer (and output the same clock to other devices)
UP TRIG and BUTTON: if ON the sequence will go UP (normally is DOWN)
RND btn: if light up the next stage is randomized

OUTS A B C D E are the CV outs of the sequencer
ROT knob, from -5 to +5, is the number of steps the yellow channel will rotate jump and rotate  if in sequencer mode
LAST trig out: PULSE out when last step is reached
TRIG (global): current stage TRIG out (with repetitions if any)
CHAIN A B C D E  and CHAIN TRIG are useful when chaining many SQUONKs (to have just one connection for the CV and TRIGs)

START STOP RESET: sequencer status controls by BUTTON or by TRIG

RANDOMIZE ALL: must be pressed with COMMAND KEY (too dangerous!)

-- SOYMODELSOU
---- IS an imitation of the FLUCTUATING, QUANTIZED and STORED voltages sections of the Buchla 266 Source of Uncertainty
---- FLUCTUATING RANDOM VOLTAGES 1
control TIME via CV and KNOB: from 0.05 to 50 sampling per seconds
OUTS: SMOOTH, HARD (the sampled voltage),  PULSE ( when HARD > 0.5)

---- FLUCTUATING RANDOM VOLTAGES 2
control TIME via CV and KNOB from 0.05 to 50 sampling per seconds
has a different smoothing function that can be controlled via CV
OUTS: SMOOTH, HARD (the sampled voltage),  PULSE (when HARD > 0.5)

---- QUANTIZED RANDOM VOLTAGES
2 sections: 2^n and n+1, where N is form 1 to 6 (established via CV and KNOB)
the n+1 distribution is a Triangular distribution (like throwing 2 dice)

n+1 are in 1V jumps
2^n are in 1/12V jumps

---- STORED RANDOM VOLTAGES
Random with SKEWING function (CV controllable) to have more events in LOW MID or HIGH ranges

-- HOTUNA
---- add TUNE "A = " param (so you can tune to "432Hz" now")
---- addeed TUNE reference OSCILLATOR
---- add DO RE MI mode
---- INSTABILYT light (the background will become lighed RED if reading is invalid)
---- SMOOTHER come back to ZERO of the needle
---- IF FREQ not recognized, now goes to ZERO




v0.5.2.1 2017-11-27
-- more WORKAROUND (to correct vcv files)
---- change
"plugin": "NYSTHI",

"model": "HiVerb",

---- change
"plugin": "NYSTHI",
"model": "Model 277",
to:
"plugin": "NYSTHI",
"model": "Model277",


-- HOTUNA
---- the VU meter will give info about the note, the big black one text is the
---- frequency (expressed as MIDINOTE TAG) we are targeting;
---- starts to become GREEN when is at less than 4 % deviation
---- and RED when there is less than 0.5% of deviation

---- the TUNER works on SIGNALs (vco inputs, or any signal you want)
---- and with VOLTAGES (translated interanally in frequencies) + the offset given by the OCTAVE
---- POT (goes from -2 to +2 octaves)

---- the IN SIGNAL input has priority (if both are used)

v0.5.0 2017-11-19
- QUADSIMPLER
    - the son of SIMPLER, is a multi sample player with integrated stereo mixer
    - 4 equivalent sample player with
        LOAD sample button (load WAV or AIFF, PCM)
        GATE mode (when in GATE mode the sample will play when the signal is HIGH and STOP when TRIG is LOW)
        1-SHOT
        TRIG BTN (to start a sample manually, or GATE IT)
        TRIG IN (to start a sample with a trig in signal or used in GATE mode)
        STOP IN (a trign signal will stop the sample)
        START will move the start point of the sample
        FM CTRL from -2 to +2, by default is 1 and the input in FMIN/CV will be 1V/oct
        FMIN/CV (to modulate frequency)
        SPEED setting the base SPEED of the sample
        PAN to place the sample in the stereo field
        VOL volume of the smaple
        OUT the direct OUT of the sample player

    all the paramenters are repeated 4 times

    GLOBAL parameters is CHAIN IN of another mixer that will be summed to Channel L and R
    the idea is to have multiple QuadSimpler to have a BIG bank of samples
